            <p><strong>Question: </strong> What version of Japanese Bridge is this? <br>
                <strong>Context: </strong>  I'm aware that Monet painted multiple versions of the "Japanese Bridge." Which specific version is this? Do you know when and where did he paint it? Is it possible to view this version in Paris? <br>
                <strong>Reference Answer:</strong> The full name of this painting is "Water Lilies and Japanese Bridge". Claude Monet painted it on 1899 in Giverny, France. You cannot find it in Paris as it is exhibited in Art Museum of Princeton University.</strong> <br>
            <strong>Model's Answer: </strong> The painting titled "Water Lilies and Japanese Bridge" was created by Claude Monet in 1899 in Giverny. Although one might associate Monet with Paris, this particular work is on display at the Princeton University Art Museum, not in Paris. </p>
